            <h3>Ultimate Chopper</h3>
            <p>The Ultimate Chopper is an absolute beast when it comes to deep chops with crazy spin reversal. It has incredible control, due to its high tech pimples composition. It is reasonably fast so that it will take home the point if a high ball comes. It has some grip, making it possible to perform game-ending drives against inaccurate serves. This racket is best suited for deep choppers and will just be a joy to play for all defensive players.</p>

            <h3>Unstoppable Force</h3>
            <p>The Unstoppable Force is created to push the boundaries of attacking play in table tennis. With the new hyper-tension rubber ontop of a really stiff and bouncy sponge this racket is made to end the game rapidly. The premium rubber technology allows for some absurd top-spins. Due the the immense speed the ball will have a flat arc. The racket does require some finesse to handle and is suited for intermediate to professional level players.</p>

              <li><b>Speed:</b><span>100</span></li>

              <li><b>Control:</b><span>60</span></li>
